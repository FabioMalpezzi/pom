## Static Context

_Stable facts about the project. Update only when the project's direction, stack, or permanent constraints change._

### Project Purpose

POM (Project Operating Memory) is a meta-method that gives any AI-assisted software project a shared, version-controlled operating memory: skills, prompts, templates, governance, and ADRs that live in the target repo and are loaded by the coding agent on demand. POM is **method**, not runtime: the artifacts it ships travel with the target project; no central server, no LLM inside POM itself.

### Key Constraints And Decisions

- **No runtime in POM**. POM provides schema, templates, prompts, skills. Execution lives in the target project's own stack (see `templates/WORKFLOW_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` Pattern A/B/C for workflow runtimes).
- **No async / no shared state / no inheritance** — the four pillars of POM workflow modeling (SPEC-0006).
- **No promotion to canonical paths (`skills/`, `prompts/`, `specs/`, `decisions/`) before the originating experiment closes** — discipline declared in `templates/WORKFLOW_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`. The single explicit exception (workflow examples in `templates/examples/workflow/loop-goal/`) is documented in the commit message of `8da0a25`.
- **No client names in public artifacts** — confidentiality rule documented in the auto-memory and enforced by commit `2ef139e`.

### Files To Always Read When Resuming

- `README.md`
- `CONTEXT.md`
- `PROJECT_STATE.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md` (recent entries)
- `experiments/<active topic>/EXPERIMENT.md` for any open experiment

### Do Not Do Without Decision

- Promote anything to canonical paths if the originating experiment has not closed (except where explicitly documented).
- Add a runtime dependency (LLM client, FSM library, scheduler) to the POM source repo itself.
- Mention client identities in any committed POM artifact.
- Force-push to `main` or rewrite tag history (e.g. `v0.2.0`).

## Dynamic Context

_Current operational state. Update at every significant session or when priorities, risks, or next actions change._

### Current State

POM v0.2.0 released and tagged. The most recent active branch is `exp/agent-loop-fsm` (commits up to `403efed` pushed to `origin`), where five hypotheses on agent loop/goal modeling (H1–H5) have all been confirmed at 100% clean fit, and several methodological byproducts have been added:

- five canonical workflow examples promoted to `templates/examples/workflow/loop-goal/` (ReAct minimal, Goal Lifecycle, flat SPAO, bounded retry, supervisor+invoke);
- one candidate skill `experiments/agent-loop-fsm/skills-candidate/loop-goal.md` with six modes (`define-criteria`, `model`, `audit`, `scenarios`, `runtime-guide`, `conclude`);
- four candidate prompts in `experiments/agent-loop-fsm/prompts-candidate/` (`define-loop-goal-criteria` v3, `audit-loop-goal-workflow`, `scenarios-loop-goal-workflow`, `conclude-loop-goal-experiment`) — all coding-agent-native;
- one external TypeScript runtime in `experiments/agent-loop-fsm/runtime-candidate/` as evidence that the modeled workflows are executable end-to-end (validated on DeepSeek);
- two auto-generated outputs in `experiments/agent-loop-fsm/design/` (`*-auto.fit.md`, `agent-supervisor.scenarios.md`) as proof that the same tasks are automatable by an external LLM.

The `agent-loop-fsm` experiment is **formally closed (2026-05-30)**: H1–H5 all Confirmed; H6 `loop_guard` and H7 `timeout` (schema-level primitives) delegated to a separate experiment `exp/schema-loop-guard-timeout` (→ SPEC-0007), admitted meanwhile as "expected extensions". What remains is the **promotion** of skill `loop-goal` + the four prompts to canonical (gated only on a short ADR on the `workflow`↔`loop-goal` relationship). Prompt v3 of `define-loop-goal-criteria` (Consistency Check section 7 + dialog-mode note, resolving D1–D5) was written on 2026-05-30; what remains for the prompt is its first real use in dialog-mode (the H1 test exercised only template-mode).

On 2026-05-30 the method gained a **fourth named agent and a full experiment lifecycle**, designed in confronto with the user:
- `define-criteria` was re-framed from an extractive interview into a **reasoned confronto** (the agent proposes, motivates, shows consequences on the objective, accepts off-grid questions), with an explicit boundary (the agent proposes and challenges but does not decide for the user, and must declare when it has over-steered) and **continuous + final auditing** (local consequences shown inline at every answer; cross-checks reconciled in section 7).
- the confronto now **leaves a trace** in a separate `*.dialog.md` file (consequences signalled, off-grid questions, user calibrations) — both an anti-shortcut safeguard (the conversational auditing otherwise leaves no trace and is the part most easily skipped when the same agent "changes hat") and raw material for future improvement.
- the fourth agent, `conclude-loop-goal-experiment`, is an **independent adversarial evaluator**: it reads only the artifacts (frozen `criteria.md`, `.fit.md`, scenarios, runtime output), never the criteria-definition dialog, and tries to falsify rather than confirm. If budget remains it leaves improvement **advice for the Coordinator** (never for the user, never retroactive); on a next round `define-criteria` reads that advice into the confronto.

The four-agent lifecycle had its **first real dialog-mode run** on the `exp/dynamic-workflows` branch (closed 2026-05-30). That experiment stress-tested the FSM schema against Anthropic's Dynamic Workflows and produced — as a **workflow-domain deliverable** (not a loop-goal artifact) — an additive **Dynamic Workflow contract**: control-plane FSM + delegated external data plane, with `fan_out_launch` / `await`{`join`: all/quorum/first, `timeout`/`on_timeout`, `react`} / `cancel`+`compensation` / `suspend`/`resume` propagated, all on top of H5/H6/H7. See `experiments/dynamic-workflows/design/CONTRACT.md`. The deliverable is destined for the **workflow** filone (SPEC-0006 extension + an ADR), not loop-goal. What returns to loop-goal is only the **methodological feedback** (recorded in `agent-loop-fsm` RESULTS §4-septies): the confronto produced a better objective, the signal moved for the first time, the adversarial evaluator (co-run with the user) refined the deliverable — which is the evidence that unblocks promoting skill `loop-goal`.

### Current Objective

Close the remaining post-experiment work by opening the H6/H7
`loop_guard` + `timeout` experiment toward SPEC-0007, then integrate the
active experiment branches toward `main`.

### Priorities

| Priority | Activity | Status | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open parallel experiment `exp/schema-loop-guard-timeout` for H6 `loop_guard` + H7 `timeout` → SPEC-0007 | **done (2026-05-31)** — adopted; SPEC-0007 complete; validator/tests/spec/guidance implemented | — |
| 2 | Write prompt v3 of `define-loop-goal-criteria` with Consistency Check (D4) + dialog-mode hint (D5) | **done (#66, 2026-05-30)** — resolves D1–D5; adds section 7 Consistency Check and a 4th promotion criterion | — |
| 3 | First real **dialog-mode** run of the full four-agent lifecycle | **done (2026-05-30)** via `exp/dynamic-workflows`; feedback in `agent-loop-fsm` §4-septies (4 limits to fold into prompt v4 + skill promotion) | — |
| 3b | Promote the **Dynamic Workflow contract** to the workflow filone: an ADR (control-plane/data-plane doctrine) + SPEC-0006 backlog entries for `fan_out_launch`/`await`/`compensation`; real validator+executor at target deploy | **done (2026-05-31)** — `decisions/ADR-0004-dynamic-workflow-control-plane.md` + SPEC-0006 backlog | — |
| 3c | Two **reference executors** of the contract (TypeScript, Python), simple in structure but functionally complete | **done (2026-05-30)** — both verified on the scenarios; in `experiments/dynamic-workflows/runtime/` | — |
| 4 | Auditor v2: add explicit "follow `state-invoke`/`event-invoke`" instruction to the audit prompt | **done (2026-05-31)** — already present in `prompts/29-loop-goal-audit.md`; confirmed by current-turn read | — |
| 5 | Runtime: implement actual snapshot write/restore (the runtime today shows state+context are alive but doesn't serialize them) | **done (2026-05-31)** — `agent-runtime.ts` supports `--snapshot` and `--restore`; README updated | — |
| 6 | Promote `skills-candidate/loop-goal.md` → `skills/loop-goal.md` + the 4 prompts to `prompts/28..31-loop-goal-*.md` | **done (2026-05-30)** — skill canonical, prompts numbered, registries updated; candidates kept in the closed experiment as history | — |
| 6a | Short **ADR**: relationship between generic `workflow` skill and the `loop-goal` sub-type | **done** — `decisions/ADR-0003-workflow-vs-loop-goal-skill.md` | — |
| 7 | TypeScript guided code for pipeline orchestrator (inherited from workflow-modeling) | pending (#45) | deferred until POM deploy on a target project |
| 8 | **Integrate branches** `exp/agent-loop-fsm` + `exp/dynamic-workflows` + H6/H7 changes toward `main` | pending | non-urgent; they overlap, so merge with care |

### Next Actions

Stato a fine sessione 2026-05-30: il **lato metodo è completo** (agent-loop-fsm chiuso; prompt v4; ADR-0003; skill `loop-goal` + 4 prompt promossi a canonici; tutto pushato). Restano tre fronti aperti, registrati come da fare:

- [x] **Lato workflow — promuovere il contratto Dynamic Workflow** (priorità 3b): dottrina control-plane/data-plane registrata in `decisions/ADR-0004-dynamic-workflow-control-plane.md`; backlog SPEC-0006 aggiornato con `fan_out_launch`/`await`/`join`/`timeout`/`react`/`compensation`. Implementazione vera del validator+esecutori rimandata al deploy su un target.
- [x] **Runtime agent-loop-fsm**: snapshot/restore reale aggiunto al runtime dimostrativo con `--snapshot` e `--restore`.
- [x] **Auditor v2**: l'istruzione di seguire `state-invoke`/`event-invoke` è già presente nel prompt canonico `prompts/29-loop-goal-audit.md`; nessuna modifica duplicativa necessaria.
- [x] **Esperimento H6/H7** (priorità 1): adottato. SPEC-0007 è completa; validator E060-E073/W060, esempi, fixture, test automatico e guida Pattern A/B/C sono presenti.
- [ ] **Integrare i rami verso `main`** (priorità 8): `exp/agent-loop-fsm`, `exp/dynamic-workflows` e le modifiche H6/H7 si sovrappongono; merge con cura.
- [ ] **Dynamic Workflow follow-up — handle lifecycle**: specificare e testare dichiarazione/uso degli handle di `fan_out_launch` (`handle` unico, `await.handles` risolti, handle non awaited, cancel/detach/terminal con handle attivi, suspend/restore di tutti gli handle). Questo è fuori da H6/H7 e appartiene al prossimo giro Dynamic Workflow.

(Spunto non azionabile, registrato a parte: Prolog è un fit naturale per *validare/verificare* i workflow — non per eseguirli; valutazione esplorativa, non una cosa da fare.)

### Open Decisions

- Whether to promote the workflow examples already moved to `templates/examples/workflow/loop-goal/` further (e.g. into a worked tutorial in `docs/`) or leave them as examples-only.
- Whether the `runtime-candidate/` should ever become a "reference runtime" documented in `templates/`, or whether it remains in the experiment folder as historical evidence (current direction: the latter, consistent with "no runtime in POM").
- **Whether to generalize the criterion-definition method beyond loop/goal to all POM experiments** (idea raised by the user 2026-05-30). The structure is already mostly generic — `define-criteria` covers ten POM scopes, of which loop/goal is only a sub-type; the generic layer (reasoned confronto, coherence auditor, trace, independent adversarial evaluator, advice loop) is separable from the loop/goal-specific layer (FSM modeling, fit classification, backlog primitives, terminal-coverage scenarios, runtime). It would relate to the existing lighter `prompts/09-run-temporary-experiment.md` / `skills/spike.md` via a rigor threshold (light exploration below, measurable-hypothesis experiment above), not replace them. **Agreed direction: experiment and bring the loop/goal criterion to regime first, then evaluate if and how to extend** — generalizing an as-yet-unproven method would violate POM's "no promotion before evidence". A clean way to do both at once: treat "generalize the criterion" as itself a POM experiment (scope 1) and use it as the first dialog-mode exercise of the criterion.

### Blockers / Risks

- **None blocking**. All open items are scheduled, not blocked. The main risk is scope drift if a new POM use case opens and pulls focus before `agent-loop-fsm` is formally closed.
- Minor risk: the prompt v3 changes might invalidate the worked `criteria-experiment-1-h1.md` produced during H1; mitigation: archive the current criteria file as v1 if v3 enforces a structurally different shape.

### To Clarify

- Whether the next Dynamic Workflow pass should introduce an explicit
  `detach` construct for active handles that are intentionally left to
  complete outside the parent FSM lifecycle. Current bias: require an
  explicit choice before terminal state: await, cancel, or detach.
